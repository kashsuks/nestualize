# Welcome

An app that allows Hack Clubber's to visualize [Hack Club's Nest](https://hackclub.app/)

## What is Nestualize

The description I gave before is quite vague. Here is a better one.

Nestualize is an app built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) that allows Hack Clubbers (teenagers part of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)) to visualize this complex web of commands that they call Nest.

[Nest](https://hackclub.app/) is free compute (computers!!) for teenagers to use for personal projects. Think Discord bots, personal sites, Slack bots, whatever you can imagine!

## Setup & Installation

In order to install and run *Nestualize*, you can go to the install page on the [Github Releases](https://github.com/kashsuks/nestualize/releases) and install the version that is specific to your operating system.

- For Windows: That is a `.exe` file
- For MacOS: That is a `.app` file
- For Linux: Depends on the distro that you've chosen, but generally a `.pkg.tar.zst` or `.app`

Once you have the packaged app ready, you can run it by clicking on it.

You would expect the startup screen with a Hack Club logo and the name `Nestualize` written as the title.
