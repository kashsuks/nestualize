# Developers

This page is solely dedicated to people who are interested in understanding *how* this project works, rather than just whether it works or not.

**Firstly**, I would like to thank you. Thank you for being interested in this project that I had visioned due to my own issues with Hack Club's Nest and knowint just how overwhelming it can be to someone new.

Once again I would like to thank you for taking time to look at this project. My hope is that people new to Nest who have absolutely no clue what they're doing can use this app to *sort of* get an idea.

You clearly know what you're doing (hopefully) and if you see an issue that I missed, a bug, an improvement, anything that could be fixed, you are free to contribute to this project.

Here is some context on how this project works file by file.
