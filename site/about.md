# About

As you probably know, I'm a Hack Clubber. I am a part of the Hack Club community and so, I use [Nest](https://hackclub.app/) and when I started, I was quite confused. I obviously knew the basic stuff like what Linux is or how to change directory, but I didn't *really* understand how SystemdD worked or how to make my own service.

The whole emphasis on using a terminal was quite hard for me. *I'm a visual person*. I need to physically see things, click things, drag others, that helps me learn. I don't learn something through blocks and blocks of text. The problem is that there aren't tools to do it visually.

I thought to myself, "why not make my own?" And that is how Nestualize started. It's nowhere close to being done and I'm fine with that. This isn't something that will finish in a day or a week or even a month.

My hope is that you as the user will be able to use Nest like normal and learn visually instead of dealing with terminal mess all at once.
