Here is a better one. Nestualize is an app built using Electron that allows Hack Clubbers (teenagers part of Hack Club ) to visualize this complex web of commands that they call Nest. Nest is free compute (computers!!) for teenagers to use for personal projects. Think Discord bots, personal sites, Slack bots, whatever you can imagine! Setup & Installation In order to install and run Nestualize , you can go to the install page on the Github Releases and install the version that is specific to your operating system. For Windows: That is a .exe file For MacOS: That is a .app file For Linux: Depends on the distro that you've chosen, but generally a .pkg.tar.zst or .app Once you have the packaged app ready, you can run it by clicking on it. You would expect the startup screen with a Hack Club logo and the name Nestualize written as the title.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"An app that allows Hack Clubber's to visualize Hack Club's Nest","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#what-is-nestualize","text":"The description I gave before is quite vague.

Firstly , I would like to thank you. Thank you for being interested in this project that I had visioned due to my own issues with Hack Club's Nest and knowint just how overwhelming it can be to someone new. Once again I would like to thank you for taking time to look at this project. My hope is that people new to Nest who have absolutely no clue what they're doing can use this app to sort of get an idea. You clearly know what you're doing (hopefully) and if you see an issue that I missed, a bug, an improvement, anything that could be fixed, you are free to contribute to this project.
